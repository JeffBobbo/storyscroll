Once upon a time there was a happy little snail named Spanglecrumb Convictthink.
The little snail was very small indeed, but fierce of heart and character.

One sunny Sunday, he decided to climb the tallest plant in all the garden
to munch on it's delicious leaves.
It was a sunflower in the corner by the garden shed,
overlooking the allotment patch
which contained potates, cabbages, carrots, and all manner of vegetables.

The climb was very tretcherous and Spanglecrumb risked his life to achieve his goal,
three days after setting out he managed to climb half way,
for a snail of his size was very slow indeed.

On day four the wind had picked up and
the rain came thundering down like a stampeed running from a pack of lions.
Unfortunately for Spanglecrub Convictthink,
it was all too much and he was blown from the sunflower by a gust of wind.
His shell smashed into pieces on the floor
and once the storm had passed, he was carried off by a raven to be consumed for lunch.
